First Piece: Cheers To The New Year! 

Geo-spatial Visualization: Making maps into an idea of holiday card and wishes for friends. 

I love the idea of creating your own maps and give it to your friends as holiday wishes. This simple spatial visualization use data to visualize what they like and around them, and create clusters of circles indicates the locations of places that they like the distance from their home addresses to the places. Beyond the data, what could be a better idea than sharing your favorite stuffs with your friends? And from an aesthetic standpoint, I love the way in which they made this visualization in a printed format, which gives the idea another layer—the precious value of holiday wishes.

Second Piece: Unfiltered News Beta 

Visualization of word clouds based on regions, performed by Google, now Jigsaw. 

Coming from a journalism background, I’ve been always interested in media coverages of affairs based on regions, news sources and how it reflects different points of view. I found this data visualization website Unfiltered.news from Periscopic. It’s a geo-based visualizations of word clouds collected from millions of news sources around the world. The larger the words, the more frequent the words would appear in the media in that regions. For example, since I am in the US now, what I see from the US cloud contains “Donald Trump” and “Ted Cruz”. From the left panel, you could see what news topics are less covered in that region. For example, in the U.S., Egypt, soccer, Ukraine, France, Democracy and tourism are less covered. What I like most about this site is that the data is updated every day. The word clouds you see today would be different than the word clouds you saw yesterday. But you can always manipulate the timeline on the right panel to see different results from different dates. In addition, you can also explore how different regions cover one specific topic by typing the topic you’re interested. It’s definitely a robust tool for studying journalism.
